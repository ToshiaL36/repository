    <p class="paragraph"> a fish is any member of a paraphyletic group of organizms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, as well as various extinct related groups.
        Most fish are ectothermic allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature. Fish are abundant in most bodies of water.
        they can be found in nearly all aquatic environments.
