        <center> Magic is the third studio album by American singer and songwriter Bruno Mars. It was released worldwide on November 18, 2016 by Atlantic Records. The follow-up to Mars's successful sophomore album, Unorthodox Jukebox, it explores genres similar
            to those of its predecessor, such as soul and funk, while Mars and his team focused on capturing the RnB sound that was very popular in the 90's, described by the singer as the reason he fell in love with music in the first place. Recording
            sessions for the album took place between early 2015 and September 2016 at Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank, fornia. The production of the album was handled by newly formed production trio Shampoo Press n Curl, consisting of Mars, Brody Brown
            and Philip Lawrence.</center>
